# Dorm Life
For my freshman year at UT, I am living in the Fred D. Brown residence hall, as a part of the Chancellor’s Living and Learning Community. Before I got to Knoxville, living in a dorm was my biggest concern about college. However, it turned out to be one of my favorite parts of it.

Over this semester I have met so many new friends in my dorm, and our floor has a community unlike any I have been in before. They are here to support me when the going gets tough, and also to have fun when we have time! From going to football games together, to having “Friendsgiving” at PCB, or looking at Christmas lights together, these new friends have helped to make my first semester at UT unforgettable.
