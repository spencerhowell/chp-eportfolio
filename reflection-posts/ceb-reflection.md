# What Becoming An Event Planner Taught Me

*My experience as a member of the Campus Events Board*

When I first arrived to campus as a freshman, I was absolutely blown away by the number of things to do and see on campus. In my first few weeks, I went to a late-night "Vol Night Long" event, saw Leslie Odom Jr. speak, and went to a concert on the lawn outside of my residence hall. All three of these events were planned by the Campus Events Board organization, and when I found out students were the ones putting these events on I knew I had to join.

I applied to join CEB my first semester on campus, and here I am four years later still planning events. Joining CEB was one of the best things I did during my time as an undergraduate at UT. Not only did I get involved on campus and make amazing friends, but I learned a lot that you can't get in the classroom!

Here's the biggest lessons that planning events taught me:

### The Importance of Adaptability

When you're planning an event, nothing ever goes completely to plan. A power cord doesn't reach, a surprise thunderstorm rolls in, or the talent doesn't show up (not to [name any names...](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2cFrymmkijnjDg9SS92EPM)).

That's why it's important to always have a backup plan, and to be able to think on your toes. Working through the problems that pop up during events has been a great lesson in resilience and flexibility. After all, the show must go on!

### Teamwork Makes the Dream Work
Hosting a student event is a large undertaking with lots of moving parts and tasks that must be done. Add on the fact that we are all busy students with limited time and it gets even trickier!

As I entered leadership positions in CEB, I found that organizing work became more and more important. I strove to ensure that all members had a clear task assigned, and that each person had the resources they needed to accomplish it. I even set up a "task board" system for our marketing chairs to use this past year, inspired by agile software development practices!

Setting teams up for success is the most important role for a leader in a student organization, in my opinion, and it's something I hope to continue to improve at in the future.

### An Internet Marketing Crash Course
You would think that an event with free food, fun, and t-shirts would practically advertise itself. Well think again! A huge part of the work that CEB does is spreading the word about each and every event.

For the last year, I've served as the VP of Communications for CEB. I have worked with the marketing chairs to manage social media, postering, graphics, and more. I've learned a lot along the way about social media metrics, graphic design, and marketing fundamentals. I know these skills will come in handy in the future, whether it's launching a new product for work or just inviting people to a birthday party!

### The Power of Community
While my reasons for joining CEB were simply to be a part of these cool events, I soon found that CEB does more than just bring in free food and bouncy castles. Student events allow people on campus to relax, have fun, learn something, and connect with each other. Seeing students enjoy events and make new friends was incredibly rewarding, and after my first Vol Night Long it had me hooked.

I'm glad to have been a part of one of the many amazing student organizations that create spaces for students to build a sense of community at UT. Planning events has made me realize that students have the power to create the culture on campus at UT. We should all work to make it as open, inclusive, engaging, and fun as possible.

College is only a few short years -- let's make the most of it!
