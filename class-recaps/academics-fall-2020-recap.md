# Fall 2020 Semester Recap
Fall 2020 was yet another primarily virtual semester, as I had only one hybrid course with the rest being completely remote. However, as we all got used to remote learning things got easier, and I was able to really enjoy my courses.

Here's what I learned this semester!

### COSC 401: Senior Design Theory
In this first semester of the senior design series, we focused on learning project management fundamentals, teamwork skills, intellectual property protection basics, and other business topics.

My team began work on Attendio, an app that makes tracking attendance easy. We laid out the initial UI/UX design and began planning out the implementation. We built a strong foundation to start with, so that next semeseter we can focus on implementing and iterating on the app.

### COSC 594: Advanced Algorithms and Programming
This is the first graduate-level course I've taken here at UT, and it is taught by Dr. Plank. This course went even more in-depth with algorithms and data structures, providing unique challenges and obstacles through a variety and coding labs.

One of my favorite projects involved using JGraph, a package Dr. Plank created that converts text files into formatted graphs, line plots and bar charts. I wrote a program that creates a graphical tree representation of your file system, starting at a specified path. I would highly recommend this class if you're up for the challenge!

### COSC 462: Parallel Programming
This course focused on the concept of parallel programming - or using multiple computers or processors to speed up the execution of a piece of software. We learned the fundamentals of threading and computer clusters, and implemented programs using the MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA libraries.

This was a difficult course, but the subject was fascinating. For my final project, I presented on Kotlin Coroutines and explained their usage and benefits. [You can watch that video presentation here!](https://youtu.be/I5n6zGfRTvI)

### ENT 460: Leading Innovation and Change
This entrepreneurship course focused on the topic of "Why do good companies fail?" I learned about the concept of disruptive technology, and what makes a technology truly disruptive. 

This course covered material such as [*The Innovator's Dilemma* by Clayton M. Christensen](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244) and [*How We Got to Now: Six Innovations that Made the Modern World* by Steven Johnson](https://www.amazon.com/How-We-Got-Now-Innovations/dp/1594633932/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=how+we+got+to+now&qid=1619455343&s=books&sr=1-1). I really enjoyed both of these books, and would recommend checking them out!

I also found this course incredibly applicable to my future career. I plan on working at an existing company, at least out of college, and understanding the competitive landscape and protecting against disruptive technology is vital for the long-term success of a company. I have already seen the applications of this knowledge at work during my internship with Garmin's research and development department.

### PHIL 244: Professional Responsibility
Finally, this is a course that is required for the breadth requirements of the Cook's Grand Challenge Engineering Honors program. It also counts towards the computer science degree requirements. However, I really had a blast with this course!

In Dr. Windeknecht's section, the course is "Dungeons and Dragons" themed, and every class session we went on "Dungeon Crawls" where we would role-play as a variety of professional characters. I was a halfling Artificer who became an expert on Utilitarianism and Corporate Social Responsibility. This was a very fun course, and I would absolutely recommend it!
