# Spring 2020 Semester Recap

The end of my Junior year at UT was certainly unconventional. Courses went completely remote following Spring Break due to COVID-19. Therefore, all of my classes shifted from being in-person to being remote, where I completed them from my parent's home.

Despite the challenges present, I was still able to learn a lot this semester, and enjoy doing it! Here's a recap of the courses I took:

### COSC 365: Programming Languages and Systems
This course explored a variety of programming paradigms and languages and discussed the definition of what a programming language even is. I got to dive into the functional programming world by learning [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) and later Haskell. (using the excellent [Learn You A Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) online textbook, which is available for free!)

We also entered the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) domain with some assignments using Java near the end of the course. I have had previous experience with Java through high school and in internships, but it's always great to go back and solidify my understanding of the basics!

I have found that exploring differing programming paradigms has greatly improved my coding abilities. Understanding that there are different ways to solve every problem, and the ability to select the best approach, is vital as a developer.

### COSC 466: Software Security


### ENGL 360: Technical and Professional Writing


### ENT 451: New Venture Planning


### IE 405: Engineering Economic Analysis
