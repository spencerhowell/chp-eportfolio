# Spring 2020 Semester Recap

The end of my Junior year at UT was certainly unconventional. Courses went completely remote following Spring Break due to COVID-19. Therefore, all of my classes shifted from being in-person to being remote, where I completed them from my parent's home.

Despite the challenges present, I was still able to learn a lot this semester, and enjoy doing it! Here's a recap of the courses I took:

### COSC 365: Programming Languages and Systems
This course explored a variety of programming paradigms and languages and discussed the definition of what a programming language even is. I got to dive into the functional programming world by learning [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) and later Haskell. (using the excellent [Learn You A Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) online textbook, which is available for free!)

We also entered the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) domain with some assignments using Java near the end of the course. I have had previous experience with Java through high school and in internships, but it's always great to go back and solidify my understanding of the basics!

I have found that exploring differing programming paradigms has greatly improved my coding abilities. Understanding that there are different ways to solve every problem, and the ability to select the best approach, is vital as a developer.

### COSC 466: Software Security
In this course, I learned about the most common software security exploits, and most importantly how to protect software against them. These exploits ranged from assembly-level buffer overflows and arbitrary code execution to SQL injection and cross-site scripting. I also participated in some Capture The Flag (CTF) cybersecurity competitions for the class, which put my skills to the test. 

### ENGL 360: Technical and Professional Writing
In this course, I was able to learn the rules and best practices for modern professional writing. I have found communication to be incredibly important for software development in my internships, as well as in group projects in class. Therefore, this course is very applicable to my future career.

For a fun twist, this entire course was taught from the context of the Battlestar Galactica TV show, with the final project being a "Cylon Defense Force Manual" providing instructions on how to survive a Cylon attack.

### ENT 451: New Venture Planning
This entrepreneurship course focused on creating business plans for both new companies and existing organizations. The course utilized the "Business Model Canvas" framework for organizing how a venture creates and captures value.

As part of a team, I worked with a local startup company ENTREOS to develop a business model canvas for their organization. As the pandemic began during this semester, our final presentation focused on suggestions for changes to make to the canvas in response to COVID-19.

I learned a lot in this course, and I really enjoyed working with real-life companies to get hands-on experience!

### IE 405: Engineering Economic Analysis
This course also fulfilled a requirement for my entrepreneurship minor. It covered the topic of economic analysis for engineering topics, including:
- Discounted cash-flow technique
- Depreciation schedules
- Risk analysis
- Investing in financial market
- Financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, cost of goods sold, business ratio)

These are all topics I had no experience with before, and understanding them helps me better understand how decisions are made in management for engineering projects. Plus, I picked up some new Excel tricks!
