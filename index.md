# Welcome! :tangerine: 
![Me in Neyland](./img/me.jpg)

Hello, Iâ€™m Spencer Howell, and this is my ePortfolio! I am a senior here at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where I am majoring in computer science in the Tickle College of Engineering with a minor in entrepreneurship from the Haslam College of Business.

As a member of the Chancellor's Honors program, I have been able to have a variety of unique and educational experiences that have expanded and enhanced my four years as an undergraduate at UT. In this ePortfolio I have documented these experiences to share with other students and with the world!

Thanks for reading, and feel free to contact me at [spencerhowell@tennessee.edu](mailto:spencerhowell@tennessee.edu) if you'd like to chat!
