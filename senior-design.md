# Senior Design Project
*Please note: My senior design team is still working on finishing up our project, so this page is not final! It will be updated when the final project deliverable is complete.*
### Team Members: Ben Greenberg, Tucker Miles, Vicki Tang, Daniel Troutman

As a part of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department's curriculum at UT, all seniors take senior design courses (COSC 401 Senior Design Theory and COSC 402 Senior Design Practicum). Part of these courses is to create a project as part of a senior design team.

My team decided to develop a software application to solve a real-world problem. We wanted to apply modern software development techniques and best practices to learn about the development process. Working together, we created:

## Attendio: Attendance Tracking Made Easy

Every day on campus, student organizations hold meetings in classrooms to plan events, socialize, network, learn, and have fun together. Typically membership in an organization has attendance requirements, and a membership chair is assigned the duty of ensuring that each member is meeting those requirements.

However, taking attendance can be tedious and difficult to keep track of. Therefore, we created a mobile and web app that simplifies the process.

## Using Attendio

First, the user can sign in using their UT NetID:
![Attendio Sign In](/chp-eportfolio/img/attendio-sign-in.png)

Then, the user taking attendance can view their scheduled events, or add a new one with the click of a button: 
![Attendio Events](/chp-eportfolio/img/attendio-events.png)

When they are ready, they click "Take Attendance" to display a large QR code. This can be displayed on the project in the classroom, or just on a laptop screen.
![Attendio Take Attendance](/chp-eportfolio/img/attendio-take-attendance.png)

All the attendees can use the mobile version of Attendio to scan the QR code (or they can simply scan from their phone's camera).

And like that, the user will be checked into the event! The event host can go back later and view exactly who was present and who was not.

## Development

We went through the entire software development lifecycle while creating Attendio, splitting our work up into Agile sprints and delegating tasks to each member.

The work we did included:
- Requirement Collection 
- UX/UI Design
- Mobile and Web app development
- Software Testing
- DevOps and Continuous Integration

For my contribution, I created the web UX/UI design, as well as developing multiple app screens for both web and mobile. I learned a lot through this project, and I'm happy to see the final outocome!

## Future Steps
Our team is still actively developing Attendio, and we hope to continue adding features even after the course is complete. We are also currently working on our final poster presentation, which I will include here when it is complete.
