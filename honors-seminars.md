# Honors Seminars

## Spring 2021 Honors Seminars

The Spring 2021 semester once again looked different than in the past, as all but one of my classes were remote and COVID-19 still meant most gatherings were restricted. Therefore, I attended virtual honors seminars throughout the semester. These events were still engaging and educational, despite not being in person! Here's some more info about each of the seminars:

### 1. ORNL Computing Facility Virtual Tour
###### _April 9th, 2021_

In this virtual tour, high-performance computing engineer Subil Abraham walked us through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's supercomputing facility. This facility includes the Summit supercomputer, one of the fastest in the world! He gave us details of how the systems are designed, managed, and used for research purposes. 

I am lucky enough to have toured ORNL in 2019, but I didn't get to spend a ton of time at the computing facility. Therefore, I was really happy to hear more about it in this event! As a computer science student, I find it very fascinating. I even learned how to write programs for systems such as Summit in a course on Parallel Programming. Thanks to ORNL for the tour!

### 2. Witnessing Microaggressions in a STEM Context: Affects on Women and Men
_April 9th, 2021_

This presentation by psychology graduate students discussed the impacts and implications on performance after students witness microaggressions in a STEM project group setting. I found this research really interesting and important, as I want to work towards making STEM inclusive and welcoming to all. I was interested to see how I as an individual could help in this effort. 

I enjoyed learning about the research methods that psychologist use to test hypothesis, as well as the details of the study methodology. This related a bit to some of the customer research I've done in entrepreneurship classes, but with a more formal and scientific approach. It's good to see and learn from studies like this, both from a research perspective as well as a social and cultural one.

### 3. Discover Life in America
_April 22nd, 2021_

In this talk from Todd Witcher from the Discover Life in America organization, I learned about the current threats to biodiversity in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and elsewhere. I love going to the National Park and surrounding areas for hikes and camping, and I definitely want to help protect it! Learning about the work his organization does to record and protect all species in the area was really interesting. 

I was shocked to learn that while 21,000 species are known in the park, up to 60,000 to 80,000 species live in the park! DLiA certainly has their work cut out for them in this effort. I would definitely like to help them out with the "Snap It and Map It" program next time I'm in the park! [You can find more information about that here.](https://dlia.org/snapit-mapit/)

## Fall 2020 Honors Seminars

In the Fall 2020 semester, Honors Seminars looked a bit different than normal! Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of these seminars were hosted remotely using ZOOM. However, I was still able to attend a wide variety of events, and learn about some interesting and important topics!

Here's the events that I attended:

### 1. Ace Your Classes & Have Fun Too!
_August 31st, 2020_

This presentation by Psychology Professor Dr. Bob DuBois focused on methods to fully utilize your time and energy while studying. If you can use your time as effectively as possible, you can get amazing grades without studying for hours on end!

Some of the top tips I learned in this seminar were:

* When studying, make sure to focus completely on your work - remove distractions.
* Cultivate intense periods of focus with regular breaks.
* Test yourself over the course material by teaching a friend, or making your own flash cards.

I know that I personally have gotten much more effective at studying since my freshman year here at UT, but there is always room for improvement! Creating effective study habits is vital for success in college, so I'm glad this seminar was able to help me improve in this area.

### 2. How To Vote
_October 22nd, 2020_

In this seminar presented by Donna Braquet with VolsVote, we were given an overview of how to cast a vote in the upcoming November 2020 elections. I believe this effort is more important than ever this year, given the huge changes that have been made to the voting process.

This seminar went over voter registration, ways to vote, and tips for ensuring your vote is received via mail-in ballot. I was able to mail my vote back to my home county, to make sure I exercised my right to be represented! 

Big thanks to the VolsVote organization for ensuring all UT students are represented this year!

### 3. An Evening of Poetry, Love, and Enlightenment with Nikki Giovanni
_November 9th, 2020_

In this online discussion and presentation by esteemed poet, writer, activist, and educator Nikki Giovanni, she talked about everything from poetry to history to the civil rights movement. Her incredible stories were absolutely awesome to hear, and she compared her life to the present state of the world in a way that was truly insightful for me to hear. In addition, she read some of her poetry and other works, which were incredible to hear presented, even in the online format.

As a member of the Campus Events Board, I helped bring Ms. Giovanni to campus, and I am so glad that we were able to have her speak to our students! I think this event was perfect for the current times and circumstances, especially considering its timing right after the presidential election.
