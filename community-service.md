# Community Service

One of the requirements for each member of the Chancellor's Honors program is serving the community of Knoxville. As a new member of the Knoxville community, I found community service to be a great way to get to know the area and the people that live here! It is very rewarding to give back to the community that welcomed me just a few short years ago.

I was able to help with a variety of organizations through this community service. Here's some information about some of the ones I helped with:

### UT Office of Sustainability
The UT Recycling group is responsible for managing waste all over campus, including on football game days! I was able to help in this effort as a "Waste Warrior" by collecting waste and properly disposing of it in an eco-friendly way. It's thanks to the efforts of the UT Recycling team that "Zero Waste Game Days" have been so successful. I'm glad to be a part of it!

### Habitat for Humanity
Habitat for Humanity is a nationwide nonprofit organization that builds houses for those who need them. I was able to work on a couple of different house builds during my time as an undergraduate at UT. Talking to the workers on the site and to the homeowners was always rewarding, and I was able to put my engineering education to the test! If you'd like to help out with Habitat builds in the future, [here is the Knoxville website!](https://knoxvillehabitatforhumanity.com/)

### East Tennessee Children's Hospital
The East Tennessee Children's Hospital is right down the street from campus, making it a very important part of UT's community! I was able to help out with several efforts that the hospital put on, including directing traffic to their parking lot and their [Fantasy of Trees](https://www.etch.com/ways-to-give/events/fantasy-of-trees/) event that is always a hit around Knoxville! Both of these raise money that goes to support the hospital's patients. [You can find volunteer opportunities at their website here!](https://www.etch.com/community/volunteer/)

### Knoxville Area Rescue Mission
Commonly known as "KARM", this organization provides food, shelter, and resources to people experiencing homelessness. Through the Chancellor's Honors Program, I helped create greeting cards that are placed on guest's beds each and every night.
