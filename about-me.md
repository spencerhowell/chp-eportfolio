# About Me 

Before moving to Knoxville for college, I grew up in Murfreesboro, Tennessee with my sister Macey and my brother Bryson. I went to Central Magnet School, where I gained an interest in computers and software through the computer club, robotics team, and three years of computer science courses.

This gave me a foundation that I would expand by enrolling in UTK to study computer science. As I learned more throughout my years at UTK, I became more interested in computer science topics and the applications of it in software development. I continued learning as much as I could through both classes and internship experiences, with the goal of beginning a career as a software engineer.

Due to requirements for the Cook's Grand Challenge Engineering Honors program, I took a couple of courses in Entrepreneurship from the Haslam College of Business. I found these courses very exciting and applicable to my future career. I believe a spirit of entrepreneurship can be applied to any business problem, and these courses have given me a foundation of business knowledge to apply. Therefore, I declared my minor in Entrepreneurship and continued to take courses in the business college.

I am now working as a Software Engineer Intern for Garmin. I am currently a member of the "Area 51" team, Garmin's internal research and development division. This role allows me to apply my passions for both software engineering and entrepreneurship as I work on cutting-edge products in new markets. I have been working remotely part-time for this team for the last year.

I'm now looking forward to continuing my education next year by pursuing a master's degree in computer science at UT. As part of the 5 year BS/MS program, I have been taking several graduate-level courses during my senior year, and should complete the degree by next spring. After that, I will enter the workforce as a software engineer.
