# About Me 👨‍💻 

Before moving to Knoxville for college, I grew up in Murfreesboro, Tennessee with my sister Macey and my brother Bryson. I went to Central Magnet School, where I gained an interest in computers and software through the computer club, robotics team, and three years of computer science courses.

This gave me a foundation that I would expand by enrolling in UTK to study computer science. As I learned more throughout my years at UTK, I became more interested in the field and the applications of it through software engineering. I continued learning as much as I could through both classes and internship experiences, with the goal of beginning a career as a software engineer.
